# Setup and configuration

[Back to the README](../README.md)

Run the installation commands in the README first. The instructions below configure a development checkout; the packaged app uses its own runtime directory.

## Configure a profile

From the repository root, create your configuration and private profile:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
mkdir -p smartapply/profile/data
cp smartapply/profile/mock_profile/*.json smartapply/profile/data/
```

Edit the copied profile files with your experience, skills, and preferences. The supplied example defines the file format and contains placeholder data.

## Providers

Set credentials in `.env` for the providers you use:

| Setting | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | AI analysis, document generation, and OpenAI embeddings |
| `FRANCETRAVAIL_CLIENT_ID`, `FRANCETRAVAIL_CLIENT_SECRET` | France Travail API access |
| `APIFY_TOKEN` | LinkedIn collection through Apify |
| `SERPAPI_API_KEY` | Google Jobs collection |
| `WTTJ_COOKIE` | Authenticated Welcome to the Jungle feed |
| `EMBEDDINGS_PROVIDER` | `openai`, `local`, or `mock` |

See [`.env.example`](../.env.example) for defaults and the [source guides](sources/README.md) for connector-specific setup.

To explore without an AI API key, use:

```dotenv
LLM_PROVIDER=mock
EMBEDDINGS_PROVIDER=mock
```

Mock providers return deterministic responses. They do not replace live job sources; add offers manually or configure a source to collect real listings.

## Run from source

The desktop launcher changes its working directory to the application runtime. Use absolute paths so the desktop app and CLI share the same development data. Run this block from the repository root in each new terminal session:

```bash
export ELAN_ENV_FILE="$PWD/.env"
export DATABASE_URL="sqlite:///$PWD/data/smartapply.db"
export PROFILE_DIR="$PWD/smartapply/profile/data"
export OUTPUT_DIR="$PWD/data/output"
export CACHE_DIR="$PWD/data/cache"

make init-db
make run-desktop
```

Environment variables take precedence over `.env`. Keep `.env`, the private profile, and generated data out of version control; these paths are already excluded by `.gitignore`.

## Build the macOS app

With the project `.env` and private profile configured:

```bash
make build
open dist/Elan.app
```

The first build provisions the runtime under `~/Library/Application Support/Elan`, copying the project configuration, profile, and database when available. Later builds preserve existing runtime data. When launching the packaged app, use its runtime configuration; the development environment overrides above are intended for source runs.

## Adapt the profile and matching rules

Élan is designed to be adapted. The repository publishes a safe example profile, while the deterministic matching rules are tuned for the original use case. When adapting the project to another candidate, country, role family, or hiring policy, update both the profile data and the static filters.

### Profile files

[`smartapply/profile/mock_profile/`](../smartapply/profile/mock_profile/) is the published reference profile. It documents the expected JSON structure and contains no private candidate data.

Edit the files in `smartapply/profile/data/`:

| File | Content |
|---|---|
| `identity.json` | Name, contact details, title, location, and summary |
| `preferences.json` | Target roles, accepted contracts, remote policies, languages, domains, and deal-breakers |
| `skills.json` | Skills, matching keywords, evidence, and allowed claims |
| `experiences.json` | Work history and verifiable achievements |
| `projects.json`, `education.json`, `languages.json`, `certificates.json` | Optional supporting information |
| `style_guide.json`, `template_style.json` | Writing and document presentation preferences |

Set `PROFILE_DIR` to the absolute path of your private profile. Keep real personal information out of version control; `mock_profile` is the public template.

### Matching rules

The profile controls the main user preferences, but several deterministic vocabularies and safety gates are hard-coded for predictable filtering. Review these files when the default behavior does not match your domain:

| File | What to change |
|---|---|
| [`smartapply/filtering/rules.py`](../smartapply/filtering/rules.py) | Positive and negative title keywords, hard rejects, seniority gates, description penalties, blocked contracts, and score thresholds |
| [`smartapply/pipeline/ingest/role_families.py`](../smartapply/pipeline/ingest/role_families.py) | Search role families and bilingual aliases used to expand search queries |
| [`smartapply/filtering/relevance.py`](../smartapply/filtering/relevance.py) | Bilingual role concepts, title patterns, technical concepts, and off-target role patterns |
| [`smartapply/filtering/role_signals.py`](../smartapply/filtering/role_signals.py) | Domain, analytics, engineering, and off-target signal vocabularies |
| [`smartapply/filtering/contract_signals.py`](../smartapply/filtering/contract_signals.py) | Contract markers and contextual exceptions |
| [`smartapply/filtering/seniority.py`](../smartapply/filtering/seniority.py) | Seniority and people-management patterns |
| [`smartapply/filtering/location_signals.py`](../smartapply/filtering/location_signals.py) | Location markers and foreign-location detection patterns |

Recommended order:

1. Update `preferences.json` first.
2. Adjust `rules.py` and `role_families.py` for the new target.
3. Update the deeper signal files only when you need domain-specific vocabulary or different safety gates.
4. Run the test suite after every filter change.

```bash
make test-fast
```

## Development

```bash
make check
.venv/bin/elan --help
```

The test suite uses fictional fixtures and a temporary runtime, with no private profile or API credentials required. Tokenizer tests may download a public vocabulary on their first run.
