## Set up and check your changes

Use Python 3.10+ on macOS 13+. From the repository root:

```bash
make install-desktop
make check
```

If several Python versions are installed, select one with `make install-desktop PY=python3.11`.

`make check` runs Ruff and the regression suite. Tests use a temporary runtime, a [fictional profile](tests/fixtures/README.md), and mock AI providers. They need no private profile or API credentials. Tokenizer tests download a public vocabulary on the first run.

To run the app locally, follow the [setup guide](docs/setup.md). For focused changes, run a single module with `.venv/bin/pytest tests/test_profile.py`. GitHub Actions runs the same checks on macOS with Python 3.11 and verifies that the Python package includes all application files.

## Find the right module

| Location | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `smartapply/desktop/` | Qt Quick interface and desktop services |
| `smartapply/scrapers/`, `smartapply/offers/` | Source connectors and offer normalization |
| `smartapply/filtering/`, `smartapply/ranking/`, `smartapply/dedup/` | Relevance, scoring, and duplicate detection |
| `smartapply/pipeline/`, `smartapply/jobsearch/` | Application workflow |
| `smartapply/profile/`, `smartapply/llm/`, `smartapply/cv/` | Candidate data, prompts, and document generation |
| `smartapply/database/` | Local storage |
| `tests/`, `tools/desktop_visual_check.py` | Regression tests and visual checks |
| `docs/` | Setup, source connectors, and interface guidelines |

## Submit a change

- Keep each pull request focused. Explain the problem, the resulting behavior, and the checks you ran.
- Add regression coverage for changed behavior. Use deterministic fixtures and mock external services.
- For interface changes, include screenshots and follow the [visual verification guide](docs/desktop-design.md).
- Include only application code, tests, and maintained documentation. Private profiles, credentials, databases, generated documents, build outputs, and demo-production tools stay local and are ignored by Git.

For bug reports, include reproduction steps, expected and actual behavior, macOS and Python versions, and relevant logs with credentials and personal data removed.
